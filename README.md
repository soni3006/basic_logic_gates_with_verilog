## Introduction

Logic gates are the building blocks of digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital circuits. This repository provides a clear and straightforward implementation of basic logic gates, including AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, and XNOR gates. Each gate is implemented in Verilog, making it easy to understand and modify.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to have the following tools installed:

- **Xilinx Vivado**: This is the primary tool for simulation and synthesis of the Verilog code.
- **Verilog Compiler**: You can use any Verilog compiler, but Vivado is recommended for its user-friendly interface.

### Prerequisites

1. **Xilinx Vivado Installation**: Download and install Xilinx Vivado from the official website.
2. **Basic Knowledge of Verilog**: Familiarity with Verilog syntax will help you understand the code better.

### Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soni3006/basic_logic_gates_with_verilog.git
```

## Implementation Details

The project includes Verilog files for each logic gate. Each file contains the module definition, input and output specifications, and the logical operations performed by the gate.

Each gate file follows a consistent format, making it easy to navigate through the code.

## Simulation

Simulation is a critical step in verifying the functionality of the logic gates. This section provides a brief overview of how to simulate the gates using Xilinx Vivado.

### Steps to Simulate

1. **Open Xilinx Vivado**: Launch the Vivado tool.
2. **Create a New Project**: Select "Create New Project" and follow the prompts.
3. **Add Sources**: Add the Verilog files for the gates you want to simulate.
4. **Add Testbenches**: Include the corresponding testbench files to verify the functionality.
5. **Run Simulation**: Click on "Run Simulation" to see the output waveforms.

### Expected Outputs

The simulation should show the expected output for each gate based on the input combinations. For example, the AND gate should output high only when both inputs are high.

## Testing

Each gate comes with a dedicated testbench that verifies its functionality. The testbenches apply various input combinations and check the outputs.

### Testbench Structure

Each testbench file follows a similar structure:

1. **Module Definition**: Defines the testbench module.
2. **Input Declaration**: Declares the inputs and outputs.
3. **Initial Block**: Contains the test scenarios and expected results.
4. **Simulation Control**: Includes delay statements to control the simulation timing.

### Running Tests

To run the tests, simply simulate the testbench files in Vivado. Check the output against the expected results.

## Usage

To use the implemented gates in your own projects, you can simply copy the Verilog files into your project directory. Make sure to adjust the module names and connections as needed.

### Example Usage

Here’s an example of how to instantiate an AND gate in your Verilog code:

```verilog
module top_module;
    wire a, b, c;
    
    AND_gate and1 (
        .input1(a),
        .input2(b),
        .output(c)
    );
endmodule
```
